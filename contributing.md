# Contributor Guidelines

We welcome contributions from other developers to help us make the SDK even better.
Before you contribute there are a number of things that you should know.

Firstly, please familiarise yourself with the [Github Contribution flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).

1. Create a new issue for the feature
2. Fork the project
3. Create a branch
4. Add commits
5. Open a pull request
6. Code review
7. Merge with master

Every feature should follow this procedure.

At this point you're waiting on us. We like to at least comment on, if not accept, pull requests within three business days (and, typically, one business day). We may suggest some changes or improvements or alternatives.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted, taken straight from community guidelines and best practices:

# Syntax:

Two spaces, no tabs.
No trailing whitespace.
Blank lines should not have any space.
Follow the conventions you see used in the source already.
And in case we didn't emphasize it enough: we love tests!
